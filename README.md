# TypeScript Workshop â€“ Beginner Level

Welcome to the TypeScript Workshop!

This beginner-level exercise helps you appreciate the value of TypeScript by first working in **vanilla JavaScript**, and then re-implementing the same solution in **TypeScript**.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Complete the JavaScript Exercise

Open the file `1-beginner/js/main/log-user-summary.mjs`.

Complete all the functions using the provided `User` object.

---

### 2. Run the JavaScript Tests

To check your progress, run the test file at:

`1-beginner/js/tests/log-user-summary.test.mjs`

Once **all tests pass**, move on to the TypeScript version.

---

### 3. Complete the TypeScript Version

Open the file `1-beginner/ts/main/log-user-summary.mts`.

Re-implement the same functions using TypeScript features like types, interfaces, and type annotations.

---

### 4. Run the TypeScript Tests

Run the test file at:

`1-beginner/ts/tests/log-user-summary.test.mts`

Make sure all tests pass, just like in the JavaScript version.

---

## âœ… Goal

By completing this exercise in both JavaScript and TypeScript, youâ€™ll learn to:

- Define and use static types
- Model data structures using interfaces
- Catch bugs earlier through type checking
- Write clearer and more maintainable code

---

## ðŸ§  Tips

- Reuse your working JavaScript solution as a base for the TypeScript version.
- Add types to function parameters and return values.
- Create interfaces for the `User` object and its `children`.
- Use the TypeScript compiler or test runner to check your code.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
