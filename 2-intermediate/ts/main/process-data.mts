// Write the logic for this function: 

// Should be able to take as input:
// An array of unknown values.
// An array of validation methods. See the validators file.
// A single transformer method. See the transformers file.
// Tip: Perhaps an extra helper function to narrow down types is a good idea? See the guards file.

// Should be able to output:
// An array of valid and invalid values
// The array of valid values should consist of values that passed the validation methods + have been transformed by the transformer method.
// The array of invalid values should consist of all the values that did not pass the validation methods.

// Check the unit tests for examples on inputs and outputs.

export function processData() {

  // Your code
